- **Safe Area:** Support for notched devices
- **Accessibility:** Screen reader and focus utilities

### 9. Performance Optimizations

#### CSS Performance:
- Hardware acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Efficient animations using `transform` and `opacity`
- Reduced paint and layout operations

## Implementation Notes

### CSS Organization:
1. **Mobile-first approach:** All base styles target mobile devices
2. **Progressive enhancement:** Desktop styles added via media queries
3. **Component isolation:** Each component has its own responsive styles
4. **Utility classes:** Reusable classes for common patterns

### Testing Strategy:
- Test on actual devices when possible
- Use browser dev tools for responsive testing
- Verify touch interactions on touch devices
- Test performance on slower devices

### Future Enhancements:
- Consider CSS Container Queries for more granular control
- Implement CSS Houdini for advanced animations
- Add service worker for PWA capabilities
- Consider implementing dark mode support
