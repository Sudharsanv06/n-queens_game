Expected: Game loads without errors
```

### Test API Connection
```
Browser Console (F12):
fetch('YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/health').then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
Expected: {"status":"OK","database":"Connected"}
```

### Check CORS
```
Browser Console (F12):
fetch('YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/api/auth/signup', {
